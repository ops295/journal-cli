Thank you for your interest in contributing to Journal CLI!

Guidelines

- Open an issue first for non-trivial changes or to discuss a feature.
- Create a branch from `main` or `dev` with a descriptive name: `feat/<short-desc>` or `fix/<short-desc>`.
- Send a pull request describing the change, why it helps, and any user-visible behavior changes.
- Mark the PR as draft if it is work-in-progress.
- Add tests or steps to reproduce behavior when filing bugs.

Review process

- This repository uses a review-first workflow: PRs require at least one approving review before merge.
- The default reviewer(s) are specified in `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
- The repo owner(s) will review and you can request specific reviewers when creating the PR.

Style & testing

- Keep changes small and focused.
- Follow existing code style.
- Run any local checks you have; this project is written in Go and uses `go build` to verify compilation.

Thanks — maintainers will help get your contribution merged once it meets the guidelines.
